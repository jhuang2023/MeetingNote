•	Calculate the similarity pairwise by 1-year/ 3 year
Expect the value of the similarity will jump when there is higher probability of frauds.
•	Outlier Detection 
Detect the change in the similarity values.
•	Record the parameters
•	Fill 0 as similarity value for the missing files 
Further step: using the WDM to calculate the similarity value
